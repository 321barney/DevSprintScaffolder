# SoukMatch Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based**: Drawing from Uber/Careem's transactional clarity, Airbnb's trust-building patterns, and Upwork's service provider comparison interfaces. This marketplace demands both emotional trust-building and efficient decision-making tools.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Trust Through Transparency**: Verification badges, ratings, and provider credentials prominently displayed
2. **Effortless Comparison**: Side-by-side offer views with clear value differentiation
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: RTL-ready layouts, Morocco-centric imagery, trilingual hierarchy (FR/AR/EN)
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex flows (KYC, financing) broken into digestible steps

## Typography System

**Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent Arabic/Latin support, high legibility
**Secondary Font**: IBM Plex Sans Arabic (Google Fonts) - for enhanced Arabic typography

### Hierarchy
- **Hero/Display**: text-4xl to text-6xl, font-bold (48-60px)
- **Page Titles**: text-3xl, font-semibold (30-36px)
- **Section Headers**: text-2xl, font-semibold (24px)
- **Card Titles**: text-lg, font-medium (18px)
- **Body Text**: text-base, font-normal (16px)
- **Supporting Text**: text-sm, font-normal (14px)
- **Captions/Labels**: text-xs, font-medium (12px)

**Line Height**: Generous spacing - leading-relaxed (1.625) for body text, leading-tight (1.25) for headings

---

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives**: Tailwind units of **2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16** (e.g., p-4, gap-8, my-12)

### Mobile-First Grid
- **Mobile**: Single column, full-width cards with p-4 padding
- **Tablet** (md:): 2-column grids for offer cards, p-6 padding
- **Desktop** (lg:): 3-column for provider browse, 2-column for job detail + offers, p-8 padding

### Container Strategy
- **App Container**: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8
- **Content Sections**: max-w-4xl for forms, max-w-6xl for dashboards
- **Cards**: Consistent rounded-xl with shadow-md, hover:shadow-lg transitions
